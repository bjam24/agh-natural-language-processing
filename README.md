# Natural Language Processing
## Description
This project was made for the NLP course at the AGH UST in 2024/2025. All solutions are results of my work after hours, when I was solving given tasks (topics).
All tasks are provided by <a href="https://github.com/apohllo/nlp">apohllo</a>. Be mindful that these tasks are regularly updated.
